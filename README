This is a supplemental release note for the FAR-EDGE TOG NGAC release designated:

	tog-ngac-2019-09-v0.3.4-rel-FAREDGE-updt-with-loadi

With respect to tog-ngac-2019-07-v0.3.4-rel-FAREDGE-updt, this release adds two items:

1)	paapi/loadi - load policy immediate
		This API functions similarly to the paapi/load except that instead
		of naming a file to load in the argument policyfile= , the policy *itself*
		is provided in the argument policyspec= .

		A trivial example may be found in the file TEST/loaditest.sh

2)	display_policy(policyname) - this command has been added to 'ngac' Policy Tool
		Displays the named currently loaded policy

Don't forget to use the mkngac script to create new executables for ngac and ngac-server.
