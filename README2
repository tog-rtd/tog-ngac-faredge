This is a second supplemental release note for the FAR-EDGE TOG NGAC release designated:

	tog-ngac-2019-09-v0.3.4-rel-FAREDGE-updt-with-loadi-readpol

With respect to tog-ngac-2019-07-v0.3.4-rel-FAREDGE-updt-with-loadi, this release adds the API:

	paapi/readpol - read policy in server
            Parameters
                policy= <policy identifier>
                token= <admin token>

            Effects
                No effects internal to the server.
		This API reads-out from the server it's current version of the named policy,
                or the current policy if the policy argument is not provided.

	A simple example may be found in the file TEST/loaditest2.sh which builds
        on TEST/loaditest1.sh (loaditest2.sh is juset loaditest1.sh with added readpol calls)

        An updated version of the test for loadi (previously loaditeset.sh) is in loaditest1.sh

There is also an updated version of the document:

        NGAC policy tool and policy server v0.3.4+++.pdf


Don't forget to use the mkngac script to rebuild new executables for ngac and ngac-server.
